Coughing here and there
Sick and in pain from last night
Sleep is all I want
A bright red sunrise
Filled with beauty and delight
Arranges my heart with hope


A pleasant evening
Romantic streets in Paris
Killed, done in cold blood

Picture as warzone
Music stops and ball rolling
A nightmares in live

The death in Paris
Fire with assault rifle
France close its borders

Fear and crying
Gurgling stream of hate
My pain for the world
Give me your hand
Always by your side

barefoot on the beach
they hold hands amid moonbeams
I do said the two

their joints scream some pain 
tango is their most love dance
oldies but goodies

gray streaks kissed her hair
unmoved, he caressed her face
will death end their tale?

Acid in the rain
Chances it won't heal again
Leaves our earth in pain 


from ashes to dust 
the rebirth of the phoenix 
broken, now stronger 

Sweet singing reminds me
soft summer rain
washes sweat and pain away

Darkness in my room
the pain of your absence
suddenly vivid.

Silence reigns tonight
violence does not create belief
your respect is lost

Silence reigns tonight
terrorism destroy's respect
your respect is lost

heaven awaits you
not for creating God hatred
your respect is lost

Silence reigns tonight
respect is lost and pain grows
the world anger felt

You uncovered
Your heart, my lack of wisdom,
Remorse can’t describe.

If time was replayed,
I’d have shared more heart your way,
Seen actions fore hurt.

I intended no pain,
I thought we could break cleanly,
But my thoughts were wishful.

Now I can’t undo,
And choose the outcome anew,
I apologize.

I hope this allows,
Flow, where feelings were stopped,
Recall hurts, even today.

Unable to salve,
What callous things seemed right,
Years cannot dissolve.

I thought I could solve,
The world’s pain extent with soft
Words, instead of hearing.

Her frayed soul revels
for along came Adonis
her pain thus deserts

Fake smiles bring up joy,
Hiding the pain and sadness.
Pretending for them

Life is a gift
But we have never cared
Destruction of the rain forest
And no animal is spared
Arise great Pro-man
Now raise up your sword
Do not let materialism deceive you
So stick to your word
The petroleum wells will dry up some day
And they will be no money for you to pay with in that way
The gold mines will diminish one day
And there will be no fields for our children to play
Arise Pro-human
Defend mother earth
Do not think of wealth
Or all that you can get
Life is beautiful
So let us be dutiful
As a Good Samaritan
And help your fellow African
Chinese or European
In need
To create a paradise devoid of greed
That is what I call Utopia
Not until we die
When it is all over
We can not let the children suffer
I have seen pain in my old days
The weak rise 
And the mighty fall
Armies rise to fight at the clarion call
Only the truth remains
Like a tree that stands tall
In the next millennia where shall we be?
Vanity after vanity
The rest is history
Life is a gift
And love is a blessing
Let us unite this world
And teach a good lesson

Love sometimes remains 
Like a fierce pain in a limb
 Severed long ago

I try not to say
Sorry to Japan the morn
Sunshine of Asia

I won’t be tempted
To further cloud this sore heart
With my sea water

It is not distance
That holds back the salty fluid
From my eyes but love

My own apartment
Is flooded with Japanese
Electronic stuffs

My countrymen are
Just like the moving sun and
Cannot not be there

My American
Friend’s a teacher in China
Shining so, so close

Japan has become 
My backyard in this new world
Small global village

And the eyes also
Suffer the heat of pepper
Eaten by the mouth

So your pain, Japan
Has clouded my sanity
Yet I say weep not!

For by blood have kings
Wore their crowns; and with blood have
Empires been painted

And in blood do women
Deliver forth newborn babes
Blood brings good tidings

By blood had Asia
Risen above its stormsAsk
India, ask China

So weep not Japan
For blood does bring good tidings
In all climes and times

Let the rain wash off
The pain from your memory
The rite is over

Let the sun renew
Your seas and shores to prepare
You for the new dawn.

Sadness crying rain
 
Dark storm clouds internal pain
Why
Does the weather change
Monsoons emotion
The sorrow that's in our skies
Why
Does the weather cry

Blizzards of our pain               
Flakes of soft petals presence
When
 Does the sun arise

Clouds broken in two
The first ray of hope has come
When
Does it ever stop


To fall down into the endless abyss
Your staying to watch me as I drift away from the world I once knew
What am I doing I losing control I'm going without word
Why do you watch from afar laughing as though my pain is some pleasure?
Is this the end of me? shall I die here ?
Why is it you watch me why is it you do not save me.I see you watching with a smile.
I thought it was love maybe it was greed that made you push me down down into my grave.
You seem happy maybe it because I'm dead?Yes that it
I'm happy again I was feared death but now i see it as pleasure
Why are you crying can't you not see me smile your tears or vain to me
I'm smiling as I see you suffer you killed me and now your paying for it
Here you are now you can stay by my side forever
I'm happy even more since you came now we can float together in this endless void you created
I can see your back to your old none selfish self may we both smile more

pain is growth
it is a process
of life

with pain in my joints
and counting my syllables
an haiku I’ll write

Healing does not mean curing
As it may be possible to cure our illnesses, emotional pain or medical problem
Iit is possible for us to heal ourselves


Life is but a skit
Away from home or in it
Eases pain a bit.

Autumn moon
Cloudy hide-and-seek;
A celestial play

Old folks home
In distant suburbs;
Desolate aura

Moon cake festival
Chinese mid-autumn moods;
A lovers' tryst

Chinese medicine man
Consult for pain remedy;
Acupuncture and heat

Evening stroll
Fresh air after rain;
Wet pathways

Street commotion
Fiery tempers flare;
Accidental collision

Sundry shopping list
So much to buy;
Procure a helper first

Stray mongrel barks
Empty park bench;
Invisible outcomes

Silent conversation
Beyond word sculptures;
Old couple smile and nod

Windy evening air
Pregnant wetness;
Downpour alert


Morning wake-up call
Promptly at six;
Awake to awake others

Business centre
Posh hotel facility;
Empty of faces

Bus terminal
Crowded sea of faces;
Rush hour pandemonium

In this big crowd
So many faces;
Yet each feels alone


Lips locked jaws 
jamming
Sweetened sense 
mounting migraine.
But sweet pain worth it.

A pain reliever
The great doctor of all times
Waiting for no one

The internal fire
searing away life's pain
change summers forest

born into the world
contemplating renewal
ice covered rivers

all seasons cycle

eternal rhythm

bright autumn color
death brings life and renewal
pain will fade away

hope reborn once again
upon springs breath fresh flowers
life from the seedling

universes wide

fish climb the river

many seasons live
through trials tribulations
death birth renewal

possibility
thought sparks creation expands
reality comes

the high of summer
sun triggered mania floating
as raging river

hot summer sunlight
river deprived of water
emotion dries up

life's changing seasons
shortcoming in emotion
through seasons cycle

fading pain emerge
life simple delusions made
forever change seasons

knowledge create and destruct
chill grow burning fading

depressions winter

collision course set
new medication hinders
emergence changes

therapy consoles
soul full of turmoil and change
growth changed perception

frustrated anger
hot and long like summers heat
burns living forests

lashed out judgmental
like frog tongues catch flies and food
and ponds clear water (narcissism)

racing through insights
visions clear from universe
emotion has passed

struggle the outside
fury within emotion
body change season

temperament wild
raging storms, fire burns, whiteout
collides in fury

a long time waiting 
an answer born in voices
science or spirit

invasion of dreams
war new names fear demons wake
interfere with life

reality changed
committed to a course plan
bumps along the way

mountains far distance
filled with peaks and valleys the path
treaded with caution

move forward future
never stepping back from fear
ghosts do not haunt me

searing grief
exhaled lone eagles' mate
mourning loss

grey mountain
grim ageless listener
pain absorbed
dawn calling
sun healing reaches 
heavy wings

then me and you see it the same way...i care not what happen to this body for the soul will still walk this earth watching over those it shown it love for

And yet the spirit of forgotten pain protects me, not wanting me to travel into the darkness that consumes the soul, for without this body, how can i protect those i love?

i watch and guide them for the body was lost but i shall lead them with a kind head and open armi protect their soul so they may keep watching there life grow into something beautiful.the darkness shall flee at the sight of the almighty light that watches my deed and my small soul

but for my last act shall be to vanquish the darkness that threatens life itselfbut all things come to an endwhat of the times, not yet past, but already forgotten, when i will no longer be there.....

when my fight is done i have no need for this unsettling place and with ever harming word will i walk into that everlasting light if i to be forgotten then that is fine for i have done them good and have made there life into something more then mine was.To be forgotten is fine for i shall not want a legacy

to have forged a life worth remembrance is fine, bu to make someones else worth remembering is all the better, for it means that they shall have a life worthy of my sacrifice, a life worth the pain once experienced, but never remembered, for i am now content.

after this body is lost i wish to be forgotten.to pay myself a gift is what is called.i will be content on not having left something a memory to be mourned for i with's no pain on those who have still they hearts where as i have walked this earth unknowing i died some time ago.let me be free for i am like a animal needing space time and needing that way of life.

then be free from the pain of the remembrance, and transcend to tomorrow, for that is where the future liesi shall always remember you, but i shall not mourn, for we shall meet again


Tuscany beckons
Wandering minds traveling
On the sun's last rays

The pale flesh glowing
Mother stirs from her closed bed
She slides to a stop

Where is she going?
When will the awaited day
Arrive for our sakes?

Letting go is real
Cry, celebrate, or wishing
Through it all we wait

Touched by the angels
Her heavy eyelids closing
Old thoughts will return

A warm offering
Quiescent reality
Numbing all to sleep

Brother's soft hair
Sobbing through the stagnant air
Breathing in deeply

Distant music plays
Chords of joy and pain wander
Forever reaching

Sister's loss held in
Bursting with the hope for death
Squeezing in the love

Past, present, future
Father's sad joy leaking out
Through Venetian blinds

There are no angels
Hovering where we can see
Belief quivering

God sends us no signs
Mortality challenges
At sunset right here



Sharp pain in shoulders
I've been told that this will come
broken neck outcome

Oh gentle spirit
Set loose from life’s pain and grief
Flee to the heavens

 No one sees dry tears 			
continuous soundless pain 			
a dear gentle man 			
			
Speaks sweet words always			
always do fine behavior 			
helps the needy one			
			
Man of broken heart 			
dies with a smiling face near 			
All say happy death

An empty feeling
like confusion would compare
cries, my world called fear

gamboge moon and stars
dance haloed whirlwind marriage
in violet sky

while black cypress looms
past swirling clouds as fleeting
requiem for love

through bright starry eyes
secluded heart still searches
unrequited.

drinking in the night
fully mooning the night sky
embarrassed sinks low

The moon on Wednesday night
was crescent shaped on the 
very bottom next to the earth
and it seemed like the moon 
was nearly touching the earth.

they’re almost gone now
how brown, bare the branches look
some toys in the leaves

when rain turns to snow
how sad those two last roses
brave faces with tears

apples bruised apples
scattered on the frosted green
and this twiggy frown

music in the wind
late october’s final song
dancing red and gold

talk of winter now
old dog by a crackling fire
shutters rattle      pings!

photo of dear dad
he loved that fulsome willow
fallen leaves      marker

Bursts of misty rain  
silken drops on each bending
stalk brushed by the wind.


Glacial ice melting
The climate suddenly changes
Old relationships.

When the blue jay sings
Listen how wide it ranges
The boundary of spring.

After rain rainbow
Thunder makes the coastland smile
Faith provides the oil.

So I map landscapes
With audacity to see
Change, a boomerang.

I search through petals
To find a woman's soft heart
Felt a bumbled sting

No bridge left to cross
Love drowns everything in tears
So the cuckoo sings


The rain splashing down 
murmur of the mountain streams 
Autumn will come now 


With overnight rain 
Grows higher every minute 
Dry feet wear high boots


dangerous winds rage
uprooting trees to tumble
drenched by rain torrents.

flooding waters wrath
swallow bridges crumbled stones
violence and death.

power lines cascade
sparking flames igniting homes
volatile darkness.

ocean waves invade
breaching sand dunes overflow
beaches dwell with fish.

hurricane havoc
shelters contain precious life
Mother Nature cries.


vanished polar ice
oceans’ currents all askew.
skylines blaze scarlet

comes a scathing wind
scorching land left not immersed.
waters turn crimson

moans escape parched tongues
prayers ascend to ashen skies.
pitch-dark rain pounds down

Rippling brook rushes
Swollen with spring rain gushes..
Eddie place bulrushes

Alligator suns
Basking her tough hide, sun buns..
Hippo destroys fun

Spring turns winter's tide
Nature comes quickly alive
Bees buzz hopes  for bride


sharp wind and snowfall 
etched name on ancient mountain 
light archs-cut angles 


mists circle summit
chilled lava rock formations 
Pele vacations

night falls mistily
artistic rain brushed dreamscape
Mauna Kea sleeps 


Quietly filling
 deep cups of the red blossoms.
 The morning sunrise.

 The rock bowl is full.
 Filled by the rain for the birds
 and for my quiet mind.

 Dried stalks of rhubarb
 turn brittle in the summer.
 Born again next year.

 The sparrows come back
 to say thank you for their home
 I lovingly made.


rain drips through the trees
kissing soft eyebrows and skin
overflowing eyes

tongue steals a rain drop
from the beloved’s ripe cheek
or was it a tear

goodbye soaked in the rain
farewell cries the broken heart
more tears rain drops fall


icy rain thrashing down 
coating ground with silver hues
gleaming, glistening.

moon beams shining down 
cloaking earth with silver glaze
smiling at lovers

river rushing by
crashing down slippery rocks
white water churning.

autumn leaves scattered
hues of golden browns and reds
whipped up by wind.

Screaming hurricane
trees strewn, lying uprooted
debris everywhere.

oh, elegant swan
startling snowy white feathers
astounding grace.

osprey perched high
dives and surfaces with fish
leaving just a ring.

dark gray canopy 
swells with moist trailing essence
a drenching downpour

heaven weeps its gore
cries for oppressed multitude
paradise opens

mystic rain gushes
floods fill banks with mud and blood
silently God speaks 


Fragile to the touch,
Bathing in rays open wide,
Closed at star lit eyes.

Walking aimlessly
Suddenly a star entered 
A poem happened 

What was the poem
A cascade of golden light
On her hair and neck

How lovely you look
Said golden neck,the light said,
You are lovelier

The bird in my vein 
Said to both of them, good morn
They smiled, glint on Nile

a faint star cluster
viewing ancient history
billions of years past

watching a sunset
on the beach at the ocean
touching the skyline

one quarter, one half
bright, blazing red-orange clouds
our star slowly sinks

I am observing
mighty Mother Earth spinning
my mind blows gently

He called me insane,
Blasphemy is now his game,
 It's Unforgiven

Nervous in my sleep
Passed the year with boiling heart
Pushed down the anger

Hide in detention
Feel moody in the morning
I know you are mad

Feel sorry to hear
The things you try not to say
But slipped already

We drown on emo
But hurry stood on our sane
Forgave each other

I'm glad it was you
Person who chased on my days
The love of my life

I leave you this note
for I know not other ways
to say how I feel

Like the morning breeze 
my heart traversed steadily
until I met you

Now a sorry flower
I tend to my bleeding heart
wounded by your words

O lovely lady!
When shall the gate to your heart 
be open to me?

the jaguar's tear
slides off his single whisker
clouds do sigh

three offspring
dragged into the river's teeth
one remains

they both stretch
the moment of sorrow lost
life leaps on


Death creeps quietly in
often taking by surprise
one last gasp of air

leaving behind pain
sadness, sorrow and such loss
emptiness of heart

days pass by in grief
each becomes full of torment
as one struggles on

no light just darkness
no end is yet to be found
time they say will heal

for them left behind
no peace, just grief smothering
icy heart with blackness

Pain suffering hurt
anguish sorrow agony
This circle of life

Cutting and Slicing,
Through the wind my sorrow soars,
Letting it, no more.


Summer’s thousand shades of green
Roses cruel scent
Show no sorrow at your death

My wasted heart on loving you
Risen from the ashes anew
All sorrow gone
For now we are one

when my time comes round
let my last thought be loving
with soft light abound


One resolution
Smart measure, full screen intake
Trinity means love.

From morn till night, light
Soft potent gems beckon us
Main ingredient, love.

Nutrition is gem
Light, airy rejuvenates
Strong ever ready.

Old friend is light weight
As jogger I'll glide through air
Steel stole feather's joy.

I feel glow of light
Frame pictures of healing light
Silent New Year's gift.

A heavy laden gut
The weight of a heavy heart

Strokes after midnight
received a distant sad news
a swallow has flown

Watch over us dear
I kept my prayers for you
frosted in flowers

loving and long hugs
embracing me on sad days
holding me, so close

arguing all day
saying I love you at night
truely liking me
when I am not likeable
taking the bad with the good

could not thank enough
for your overflow of love
even to my soul

Five in the morning
Orange and red glow in the east
A new day is born

A single rain drop
Looks to be the final straw
Now the flood begins

Albuquerque view
Volcanoes on the mesa
Since the age of time

Once green and growing
Now brown and brittle and free
A Tumbleweed's life

With long floppy ears
And kangaroo backleg kicks
It roams the mesa

Bone dry arroyo
But when the rains fall heavy
A river runs wild

Blackened pine tree trunks
Struggling to regain life
Only time will tell

Blistering sunlight
Sheltered cove of solid rock
A sliver of shade

Multicolored hues
Cliffs of reds, browns, blacks, and whites
Southwestern landscape

Red rock formations
As far as the eye can see
And way back in time

Rocks piled upon rocks
Balanced precariously
Thousands of years now

Upright arms of green
Prickly needle point barbs
anchored in the sand

A typical day
Arid heat of one-o-eight
No humidity

All along the ridge
Patiently waiting for years
Arms lifted towards God

Two thousand years back
These cliffs were inhabited
Why did they all leave

Striated hillsides
In the land of enchantment
Navajo glory

Six-sided hogans
Grandfather's ancient design
Still in use today

Cemetery stones
No tree to provide them shade
What a sad, sad sight

Knarly old pine tree roots
Wrapped around an ancient stone
Holding on for life 

Fluffy white mountains
Filling up an azure sky
Will it rain today?

Dancing dust devils
Whirling twirling to the sound
Of the wind's music

Shimmering mirage
The desert laughs at the lost
Nature's cruelty
A dry washboard road
Miles out through the desert
A crystal blue lake

Manmade lake at damn
Stopping mother nature's flow
Do we have the right?

Upturned leaves on tree
Frantically waving in wind
Soon the rains will come

He rattled his tail
Demanding respect from all
We complied as one

Sun rises, sun sets
Twenty four hours are over
Accomplish anything?

Not a sound was heard
Footprints only in our wake
The desert winds sleep

Not a sound is heard
Footprints only in our wake
The desert winds sleep

The crunch of gravel
Undeveloped housing roads
Early morning walks

The smell of wood smoke
Memories of the Southwest
Couldn't help but smile

Warming in the sun
Like a lizard on a rock
What a view I had

Morning wakeup call
Bacon wafting through the house
Even I got up

Pollution puddle
Reflecting rainbow colors
Do we call that art?

New Mexico winds
Neither unseen nor unheard
Constantly blowing

Some wear coats gray green
Others come on the scene clean
A process unseen

My ears my eyes poised
I saw my plum tree alive
Pregnant with ripe plums

I watched her thrived
But foreign host soon arrived
Invading her limbs

She stood out like beam
Haters scoffed at the sad scene
While elements smiled

One branch of my tree
Handed a message to me
"Life can be renewed"

A new branch emerged
Vibrant than the rest gray green
She became the queen.

the sad story is
written with great emotion
in the afternoon

All time thief of our joy.
