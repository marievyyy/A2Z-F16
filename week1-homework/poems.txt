It entices the flowers
the storm but through the garden's white,
it is not snow,
and what it is that's scattering
are, in fact, the years of my life!

Fair Yoshino,
the autumn wind in its mountains
deepens the night and
in the former capitol, cold
I hear the fulling of cloth

My sleeves are like
the rock in the offing that
can't be seen even at low tide,
unknown to anyone, but
there's not a moment they are dry.

Light and dark:
the green of the field's
young herbs
distinct in
patches of fading snow.

When the crickets
cry in the frosty night,
on the cold reed-mat,
spreading out my robe just for one,
must I sleep all alone?

How I'd like to show him!
The sleeves of the fishermen
of Male Island
when it comes to wet, are wet indeed,
but their color doesn't change!

Due to that single night
of fitful sleep, short as a reed's joint cut at the root
from Naniwa Bay,
am I to exhaust myself, like the channel markers
passing my days in longing?

While the raindrops of
the passing shower have not yet dried from
near the leaves of the evergreens,
the mist is already rising, on
this evening in autumn.

All through the night
recently, as I dwell on things,
even the gap between the doors
of my bedroom, which does not lighten,
seems cruel and heartless to me.

The crying voices
of the plovers who visit
from Awaji Island
how many nights have they awakened him,
the barrier-keepers of Suma?

I do not even know
how long your feelings will last.
My long black hair
is all disheveled and, this morning,
my thoughts too are in a tangle!

"Lament!" does it say?
Is it the moon that makes me
dwell on things? No, and yet,
look at the tears flowing down
my reproachful face!

If I live on longer,
shall I again, I wonder,
yearn for these days?
The world that I once saw as
bitter, now, is dear to me.

As I row out into
the wide-sea plain and look
all around me
the white waves of the offing
could be mistaken for clouds!

From between the breaks
in the clouds that trail
on the autumn wind
leaks through the moon
light's clear brightness!

Depending with my life
on promises that fell thick
as dew on sasemo plants
alas! the autumn of this year too
seems to be passing.

As evening falls,
through the rice-plants before the gate,
it comes visiting, and rustling
on the reeds of the simple hut
the autumn wind does blow!

It's the autumn leaves
of the hills of Mimuro,
where the tempests blow,
that are the woven brocade floating
on the waters of Tatsuta River!

In the evening
when the wind rustles the oaks
at Nara-no-Ogawa,
it is the ablutions that are
the only sign it's still summer!

"Make that heartless
woman, O mountain storm
of Hatsuse Temple
crueller still!" this is not
what I prayed for, and yet...

Known far and wide,
the unpredictable waves
of Takashi's beach
I will not let them catch me
For I'd be sorry should my sleeves get wet!

Though it is not what's in my heart,
if in this world of pain
I should linger, then
no doubt I shall remember fondly
the bright moon of this dark night!

As the winter dawn
breaks, the Uji River mist
things in patches and
revealed, here and there, are
all the shallows' fishing stakes.

With your arm as my pillow
for no more than a brief
spring night's dream,
how I would regret my name
coming, pointlessly, to 'arm!

Although there are
my sleeves that never dry,
bitter and sad,
what I really regret is
my name, made rotten by love!

Now, the only thing
I wish for is a way to say
to you directly
not through another
"I will think of you no longer!"

Although the sound of
the waterfull has ceased,
and that long ago,
its name, indeed, has carried on
and is still heard!

If only this world
could always remain the same!
The sight of them towing
the small boats of the fishermen who row in the tide
is touching indeed!

Waves that beat against the rocks,
fanned by a fierce wind
it is I alone
who breaks, those times
when I think of her!

Because it has dawned,
it will become night again
this I know, and yet,
ah, how hateful it is-
the first cold light of morning!

Like a boatman, crossing
the Strait of Yura,
whose oar-cord has snapped,
I'm lost and know not my way
on the road of love!

Not one person who would
call my plight pathetic
comes at all to mind,
and so, uselessly,
I must surely die!

When compared to
the feelings in my heart
after we'd met and loved,
I realize that in the past
I had no cares at all.

The short summer nights
while it seems yet early evening,
it has already dawned, but
where in the clouds, then,
does the moon lodge, I wonder?

The short summer nights
while it seems yet early evening,
it has already dawned, but
where in the clouds, then,
does the moon lodge, I wonder?

Ah, the weir
that the wind has flung
across the mountain stream
is the autumn foliage that cannot flow on, even though it would.

Like Izumi River
that wells up and flows,
dividing the Moors of Urns
when did I see her, I wonder,
that I should yearn for her so?


So that I thought it
the light of the lingering moon
at dawn
the white snow that has fallen
on the village of Yoshino

There is nothing so depressing
as the break of day and
leaving you after
having seen the heartless
morning moon.

It was only because you said
you would come right away
that I have waited
these long months, till even
the wan morning moon has come out.

Inadequate, but
they must shelter the folk
of this wretched world—
my ink-black sleeves, having begun to live
"in this timber forest that I enter".


Miserable,
now, it is all the same,
Channel-markers at Naniwa
even if it costs my life,
I will see you again!


This time around
I couldn’t even bring the sacred streamers
Offering Hill
but if this brocade of leaves
is to the gods’ liking...

When, from loneliness
I stand up and leave my hut
and look distractedly about:
everywhere it is the same
evening in Autumn.

In the autumn fields where the wind blows repeatedly
on the white dewdrops,
the gems, not strung together,
do scatter about indeed.

To the lonely house
where the weeds, eight layers deep,
have grown rank,
not a soul can be seen
but autumn, at least, has come.


When I look at the moon
I am overcome by the sadness
of a thousand, thousand things
even though it is not Fall
for me alone.


In the autumn fields
the hut, the temporary hut,
its thatch is rough
and so the sleeves of my robe
are dampened night by night with dew.


When I hear the voice
of the stag crying for his mate
stepping through the fallen leaves
deep in the mountains this is the time
that autumn is saddest.

Must you so avoid others' eyes
that not even at night,
along the road of dreams,
will you draw nigh like the waves
to the shore of Sumi-no-e Bay?

For my lord's sake
I went out into the fields of spring
to pick young greens
while on my robe-sleeves
the snow kept falling and falling.

Whose fault is it
that my feelings have begun to tangle
like the tangle-patterned prints
of Shinobu from the distant north?
Since it is not mine, it must be...

Even the life that
I’d not have been sorry to lose
just to meet you once,
now, having met, I think:
"I want it to last forever!"


This it is! That
going, too, and coming too,
continually separating,
those known and those unknown,
meet at the Barrier of Osaka

O tell her, at least,
that I’ve rowed out, heading towards
the innumerable isles
of the ocean's wide plain,
you fishing boats of the sea-folk!

As I set out on
the beach of Tago, and look,
I see the snow constantly falling
on the high peak of Fuji,
white as mulberry cloth.

The hundredfold palace!
even in the shinobu grass
on its old eaves
I find a past for which
I long yet ever more.

People seem dear and
people also seem hateful
when vainly
I brood about the world
this self who broods about things.

Because the current is swift,
even though the rapids,
blocked by a boulder,
are divided, like them, in the end,
we will surely meet, I know.


O heavenly breeze,
blow so as to block
their path back through the clouds!
For I would, if but for a moment,
detain these maidens' forms.

If I live on longer,
shall I again, I wonder,
yearn for these days?
The world that I once saw as
bitter, now, is dear to me!

Within this world
there is, indeed, no path!
Even deep in this mountains
I have entered, heart set,
I seem to hear the deer cry!

My hut is to
the capital’s southeast
and thus I live. But
people call it "Uji, hill
of one weary of the world," I hear.

Above the lower slopes
of the high mountains, the cherries
have blossomed!
O, mist of the near mountains,
how I wish you would not rise!

----------------

Coughing here and there
Sick and in pain from last night
Sleep is all I want
A bright red sunrise
Filled with beauty and delight
Arranges my heart with hope


A pleasant evening
Romantic streets in Paris
Killed, done in cold blood

Picture as warzone
Music stops and ball rolling
A nightmares in live

The death in Paris
Fire with assault rifle
France close its borders

Fear and crying
Gurgling stream of hate
My pain for the world
Give me your hand
Always by your side

barefoot on the beach
they hold hands amid moonbeams
I do said the two

their joints scream some pain 
tango is their most love dance
oldies but goodies

gray streaks kissed her hair
unmoved, he caressed her face
will death end their tale?
